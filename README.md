ðŸ’» Computer Science, Software Engineering, & IT Syllabus
This syllabus combines the theoretical rigor of Computer Science (CS) with the practical skills of Software Engineering (SE) and the system knowledge of Information Technology (IT), creating a robust foundation for an AI Engineer.

I. Foundational Pillars (Year 1-2)
These subjects teach you the fundamental logic, problem-solving techniques, and the structure of computing.

Foundation for AI/ML. Understanding the underlying logic of algorithms and data relationships.

Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth Rosen.

Computer Architecture

CPU, Memory Hierarchy (Cache), Data Representation (Binary, Hex), Instruction Sets.

Performance Tuning. Understanding why certain code runs fast or slow on specific hardware (CPU vs. GPU).

Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy.

II. Software Engineering & Systems (Year 2-3)
These subjects shift from theory to the practical reality of building large, reliable, and secure applications.

Subject

Tools/Technologies

Operating Systems (OS)

Processes, Threads, Concurrency, Virtual Memory, Deadlocks, File Systems.

System Reliability. Essential for debugging deployment issues in containers (Docker/K8s) and managing resource allocation.

Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne.

Databases & Data Modeling

Relational Databases (Normalization), SQL (Advanced), Transactions, Concurrency Control.

SQL Optimization. Designing feature stores and relational metadata layers efficiently.

Database System Concepts (Silberschatz) / PostgreSQL.

Why It Matters for AI/ML

Tools/Technologies

Distributed Systems

Consistency models (CAP Theorem), Load Balancing, Microservices Architecture, Message Queues.

AI Scalability. Essential for deploying PySpark and ML models across clusters (Kubernetes).

Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP.

Formal Languages & Automata

Finite Automata, Context-Free Grammars, Turing Machines.

Theoretic Foundation. Understanding the limits of computation and compiler design.

None specific, focus on theoretical understanding.

Cybersecurity Fundamentals

Key Takeaway for Your Path
Given your background, your highest leverage subjects will be Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and Distributed Systems.

DSA will make your Python/PySpark code run faster and cheaper.

Distributed Systems will teach you how to manage the infrastructure (Kubernetes, Kafka) that supports your massive ML models in production (MLOps).
